# Housing Price Prediction
End-to-end machine learning project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house using supervised machine learning techniques.
The goal is to build an end-to-end ML pipline including data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Proplem Statment
Predict the sale price of residential houses based on their characteristics.

- Task type: Regression
- Target variable: SalePrice

## Dataset
The dataset is based on a real estate housing dataset.
The data is already split into traning and test sets.

All exploratory data analysis and preprocessing decisions are performed using only the training data to avoid data leakage.
